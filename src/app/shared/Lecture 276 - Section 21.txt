Module Import Order
Section 21, Lecture 276
In the next module, we'll add routes to a feature module.
For this to work, you need to ensure that you get the import order 
(i.e. the order in which you add all modules to the imports[]  array in the AppModule ) right.

To be precise - unlike as shown in the video - you need to position your
RecipesModule  prior to the AppRoutingModule .

So imports[]  should look like this (in AppModule ):

imports: [
    ..., // Other modules
    RecipesModule,
    AppRoutingModule
]
This is required to ensure that the Catch-all/ wildcard routes work correctly.

Why does it work in the video (even though I DON'T use that setup there)? 
Because I recorded this without the wildcard route - a mistake from my side.

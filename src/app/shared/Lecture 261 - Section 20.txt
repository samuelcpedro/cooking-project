Use getIdToken() instead of getToken()
Section 20, Lecture 261
Important note: If you're using Firebase 5.x or higher (you can check the package.json  file to find out),
you should use getIdToken()  for obtaining the token, NOT getToken()  as shown in the next lectures.

Also important: When I show you where to find the token in the browser, you'll NOT find it in localStorage anymore, 
instead, it'll now be stored in IndexedDB. That's the only thing that differs - the token usage will stay the same.

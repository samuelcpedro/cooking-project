Possible Improvements
Section 20, Lecture 270
You can of course improve this app even more. Some ideas:

    - Check if a token is present at application startup 
        (check the localStorage manually or use the Firebase SDK 
        to do so - just make sure that you somehow wait for the SDK 
        to finish its initialization);
    - Redirect the user if he want to access a protected route
        (right now, nothing happens) - inject the router and call
        this.router.navigate(...) to do so
    - Redirect the user on logout so that he's not able to stay on pages 
    which are reserved for authenticated users
        you can simply inject the router and call
        this.router.navigate(...) in the logout() method
